Despite working in a Chinese-dominated market, the business has steadily increased its capacity to 2GW.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‘With initiatives such as Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat, we have boosted our local production of solar PV modules. The market is highly competitive, and as always, we have stayed abreast of other companies’ plans, government policies, emerging technologies in the space, and more,” Hitesh says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe adds that although most raw materials are available in India, suppliers cannot meet Waaree’s scale of requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"font-experiment-bq\"\u003e“For instance, we require a lot of glass and in India, we have only one company - Borosil - which makes the glass we need. Borosil also supplies to other solar brands, and we mostly only get about 25 percent of our requirements from them. Thus, we are forced to import the rest.”\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce manufactured, the solar PV modules and panels are sold to customers such as \u003cstrong\u003eschools, colleges, hospitals, \u003c/strong\u003eor others that want to install rooftop solar, as well as enterprises that want to set up \u003cstrong\u003esolar plants and parks,\u003c/strong\u003e and sell the electricity to state-run electricity boards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“At a solar park, 1MW equals around 3,500 panels.

For B2B clients, it can be difficult to deal with Chinese companies who may not understand English or know their requirements.

But the PLI amount will be exhausted by the time the funds are given to four to five such manufacturers. The rest of the offers will be on the waiting list. The incentive provided to the manufacturers also is only about 50% of the investment by the manufacturer. It is a very complex program.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to a manufacturer setting up a new module capacity for a 1 GW module manufacturing plant (without considering land and building), the equipment cost is ₹1 billion ($136 million). For a 1 GW cell (210 mm) manufacturing plant, the equipment cost is ₹4.5 billion ($613 million).

So, ₹24-25 billion ($327-341 million) in investments is needed to be eligible for PLI, and the outlay is just ₹45 Billion (~$619 million), according to the manufacturer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt’s a big players game\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother manufacturer planning to set up a solar module and cell capacity under the program said, “We plan to install 2 MW each of cell and module facilities. The investment needed for only equipment (without land and building) is $15 million for 2 GW of modules, and for 2 GW of cells, it is $40 million (European line) and 40% less if it is a Chinese line. The working capital required for a 60-day cycle at 70% plant efficiency is ₹1.6 billion ($218.5 million)/GW of modules and ₹1.1 billion ($150.2 million)/GW of cells.

Very few companies or joint ventures will be eligible to apply for the program while also completely leaving out smaller enterprises. Indian businesses usually start as small companies and expand to become larger organizations. With obligatory vertical integration and the capacity cap, only those with large manufacturing capacities will sustain in such a competitive environment. If the government wants to create a manufacturing ecosystem, it should allow standalone factories of modules, cells, and other raw materials to thrive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe further added, “Manufacturers from other countries will have an advantage given their track record, R\u0026amp;D, capital, and experience – Indian companies will have to up the ante through R\u0026amp;D to offer better efficiency modules than the current offerings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to a top domestic module manufacturer, the PLI program has no consideration for micro and small and medium enterprises (SMEs and MSMEs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother medium-size domestic manufacturer told Mercom, “We understand that manufacturing units which have imported capital goods for setting up the module manufacturing facility before the last date of bid submission will not be eligible for participation under the PLI scheme. But the import of capital goods should happen after the last date of submission. This indicates that the program is for new ventures, and they will place the order after this tender while existing ventures with current setup can’t bid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Aditya Singhania, Director of Navitas Green Solutions, the main issue with PLI is that it is out of reach for the MSME sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Singhania, with or without the PLI program, any manufacturer will have to increase their production capacity to survive. “We believe 40%-50% domestic module manufacturers will close shop by 2023. The capacities the big companies can manage will flood the market,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe further added, “Players like us, operating in 200-500 MW capacity range, will need to get into some niche products to meet our profitability rather than depend on selling modules and generating revenues. We are getting into series funding, but that is not an option for everyone. The most profitable 5-10% companies would be able to do that. The majority of the players are not well connected and would not be able to arrange for private equity funding or series funding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinghania told Mercom that many of the old solar manufacturing companies are declaring bankruptcy. Microsun Solar has been in the market for so many years and has filed for bankruptcy due to the prevailing market conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercom spoke with MicroSun’s executive manager Veeren Jain who confirmed that the company had recently filed for bankruptcy. “Yes, we have filed for bankruptcy, but it is not just because of lack of government support. We had some management issues as well, which was getting bottled up, and it eventually came down to this,” the official said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Jain, the PLI scheme reflects the pattern followed in China where the few bigger players thrive and government policies wipe out the smaller players.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the company’s future and other small and medium-sized players, Jain said, “I feel except for those who can maintain a cash flow, the rest like us will be wiped out. For medium players, the bank asks for collateral security when we approach them. If we had collateral, why would we need loans? During the pandemic, if we go to banks, they ask for our financial records, but with the economy down thanks to the pandemic, how can we show positive markers in our financial records?” He asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about MSMEs?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShiv Mittal, Managing Director of Rhine Solar, said that the small and medium manufacturers cannot showcase a sustainable costing model. “Our businesses are under threat. Around 10-12 big players can easily swallow the remaining through this incentive program. Some tenders like CPSU mandate DCR, which is the only saving grace small players have. But we cannot lose hope, and we believe that there will be a way out for small players to thrive in the market competitively. We think the government will bring some new programs for us. Our manufacturers’ association is currently working on a mechanism to communicate our grievances to the government.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother manufacturer suggested that there has to be an – Upgradation fund. There should be a fund for setting up a new facility and also upgradation. Upgradation also is like a new investment as none of the old equipment in the existing plant can be used to produce new technology modules – not even the conveyor. The whole plant has to be scrapped and a new one built. For the textile industry, the government gave an upgradation fund. What we need now is an upgradation fund rather than a PLI program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Atmanirbhar (self-reliance) initiative of the government aims to create an ecosystem that will aid Indian companies to be extremely competitive on the global stage, and for this scale and advanced technology is considered crucial. The government has addressed one challenge, but a greater one lies in deciding the fate of the numerous small manufacturers. They have been mostly catering to the supplies needed by government projects (DCR) but are on the verge of collapse and cannot keep up with the new investments required to keep pace with the fast-evolving technology.\u003c/p\u003e",

The system, with a capacity of about 1 MW, has been installed by integrating solar panels on all four walls of the facility, covering over 5,000 square feet of facade area. It is estimated that solar power system will help provide a CO2 emissions reduction equivalent to almost 7,000 trees per year.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWaaree BIPV modules were installed on the Rated-4 Hyperscale Datacenter built by CtrlS where Custom designed aluminium rails were used as module mounting structure. Frameless Waaree BIPV panels were deployed on the facade. Each Waaree BIPV solar panel was installed with power optimizers to increase energy output from PV systems by constantly tracking the maximum power point (MPPT) of each module individually. They have the capability to monitor the performance of each module.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMr. Sridhar Pinnapureddy, Founder and CEO, CtrlS Datacenters Ltd said,\u003c/strong\u003e \"The combustion of fossil fuels has led to dramatic rise in carbon dioxide emissions globally, and it is my belief that as a responsible business it is prudent to embrace clean energy. We are delighted to have partnered with WAAREE to take a major step in deployment of solar energy at our Mumbai Rated-4 Hyperscale datacenter. We chose to install the solar panels on all the four sides of the building instead of roof top solar as it provides large space for absorption of sunlight. We therefore replaced the conventional glass in our data center facility, with solar panels thereby generate higher power through clean energy and thereby reducing carbon footprint. Besides, the Waaree BIPV panels act as a thermal insulation by blocking the sun and thus also reducing the power consumption of the air conditioning system, thus saving on electricity bills considerably.

The challenge of not only the space to mount Solar Panels is addressed by Waaree BIPV solutions but also the aesthetics and beauty of building is enhanced by replacing normal glass to solar panels.

									"News_Body": "\n\u003cp\u003eLEH, Jan 1: Waaree Energies, India�s largest solar PV manufacturer, today unveiled its 25 KW rooftop solar project at Himalayan Institute of Alternatives (HIAL).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe project is done by Waaree Energies under its CSR programme and is part of its ongoing efforts to bring the current wave of solar revolution to Ladakh. HIAL has established its position as a renowned institute in the region, founded by the visionary Sonam Wangchuk. HIAL is expected to save close to INR 2 lakh per year. The installation of this project is of critical importance as solar power brings much needed respite to the people of Ladakh, since the region is cut off from the Kashmir valley for the most of winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe project has installation of 20 KW Waaree 325 Wp modules, which will help meet the power requirements of the campus, whereas the 5 KW Merlin � Flexible modules will power the Greenhouse shelter. Waaree Energies not only donated the panels, but also ensured their implementation and commissioning. The local climatic conditions, especially during the cold winters, make it imperative to have solutions that ensure self-sustainability within the region with respect to energy. Solar power presents the optimal option as Leh enjoys clear skies with a high irradiation.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eCommenting on the occasion, Sunil Rathi, Director, Waaree Energies said, \"The project is further to our commitment of making energy, especially solar, accessible to all. We have installed our indigenous systems at 1250 + Households, which are yielding over 210,000 litres as output. As we were looking at associating with organisations and individuals who are working towards bettering the society, HIAL became the natural choice. It was a pleasure to associate with a dynamic person like Sonam and HIAL.�\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eSonam Wangchuk said, \"Waaree Energies was our preferred choice when we decided to transition to solar energy at HIAL. We were well aware of Waaree�s long standing excellence in quality and service, and have first-hand seen their products and solutions. My inclination towards innovation found the perfect fitment with Waaree Energies, and we hope this is the start of a long association with them.�\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eSonam Wangchuk, who was recently awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award, is an engineer and renowned education reformist from Ladakh. The founder of SECMOL and the Ice Stupas, he was the inspiration behind Amir Khan�s character in the Hindi film 3 Idiots, propelling his efforts in Ladakh to the public eye.\u003c/p\u003e",

We got a great deal of insight into the solar energy sector from the US, Japanese and the European market models. This gave us an impetus to position ourselves better in the Indian market. We started our operations as an export-oriented company. It was only after 2010 that we started focusing on the Indian market. It has been an enriching journey so far and we have learnt along the way that a lot of players look at the solar power sector as a short-term business venture. But, the companies that are here for a long haul, say for next 50 or 100 years, they will be the ultimate winners. This has been the biggest takeaway for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your core strengths that make you stand out from other players?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat makes Waaree stand out from the rest of the players is its �customer solutions model�. We treat customers as our partners. We believe in being closer to the customer as much as possible, and work towards providing solutions that they have been looking for. We don�t just offer them the product; we make sure that they get what they want. Waaree�s approach towards doing business is different. We don�t rush into closing the deal and getting the order. We believe in having a long-term relationship with our customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to manufacturing, we strive to bring new technology every time. Q We try to improve our supply chain to reduce delivery time and facilitate quick delivery of the product to the end customer. We also focus on adding more and more test and quality check equipment to our production line to make sure that the product works efficiently. Because of all these checks and balances, our performance speaks for the company. One of the very first MW plant, the 2.2 MW plant in Germany that we built in 2009, is still performing well. It has been eight years and counting, we are still very satisfied with its performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWaaree Energies has joined hands with US-based Merlin Solar for incorporating �Merlin� technology. Tell us more about this path-breaking technology.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me explain this technology with an example. In India, even if you come up with the best model, it develops cracks when you try to transport it from the factory to the site due to the conditions of roads here. Once it develops the micro crack, it goes to the hot spot and 4-5 years later the performance deteriorates. At Waaree, we got the opportunity to replace modules for certain locations where the hot spot and micro cracks were developed. We have been striving to bring a technology in India to find a solution to this problem. Then we started looking into what more can we offer. With Merlin, we are able to lower the cost of structure as well as lower the cost of ownership. We have been able to offer flexible modules that can be used in multiple applications. So this technology improves the efficiency and lowers the cost of installation of solar modules. It transforms solar modules into less expensive, higher power generating panels. The modules are lighter, produce more power, and are more rugged and durable. And of course no micro cracks and hot spot anymore .Trust me, there is no substitute to this technology in market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your views on the GST?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGST is a positive step for the country. If we talk about the solar sector, GST gives freedom from many taxes. However, the problem for module manufacturers like us is that we will be requiring much more working capital now as the tax on the equipment or raw material which we are buying is higher than the finished products. As a model manufacturer in India, we have a tough competition from China. When we import, we just pay the 5 percent of GST and no other taxes. But if we manufacture in India, we have to shell out up to 18 % GST and heavy import duty on raw materials. Hence, I would say that GST has added to the woes of the Indian module manufacturers. For EPC also there is no clarity and the entire business is virtually on hold .Yes, it is a good initiative for the country as a whole and we hope the government will come up a solution soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a promoter of �Make in India�, do u think we can match the Chinese prices in the near future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet us understand first what determines Chinese prices. Their entire price structure is like an ecosystem. They have the luxury of government incentives, export incentives, more dollars coming into their country and they have more employment opportunities. So their supply chain is so strong that the logistics arrangements are bound to be strong along with finance cost and the availability of finance. Hence, prices there are not only determined by the manufacturers, but they are entirely managed by the supply chain and eco system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, if I want to buy 10 tonnes of good quality aluminium dully anodoised, I cannot buy it from India. The quality of anodising is a big challenge here. If I want to export from India, it takes three to seven days while China takes less than 24 hours. We need to look into the entire eco system. Going back to the cost structure, if Chinese companies want to make poly silicon, they will put the poly silicon plant next to the hydropower plant where the cost of power in China is below Rs 2. As a manufacturer, without the total ecosystem and the government support, it will always be difficult to bring the product cost on par with that of China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIndia has set a target to achieve 100 GW of solar power by 2022. What would be your contribution?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will definitely work towards increasing our market share. We will be starting a new facility by December which will give us additional 1.2 GW modules. We are all working towards achieving the capacity of 2 GW modules before March, next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat according to you are the challenges of the solar power sector?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile talking about the power sector, if discoms have money and they are making good profit then solar power will reach all. Some sections of people think it is their birth right to get free electricity or not pay market price for the power they use. I would like to request the government to give subsidy to people in cash so that they maintain the habit of paying bills. And the electricity supply of those people who are not paying their bills for a long time should be cut. Sometimes, privatisation of discoms may also help.\u003c/p\u003e   ",

It�s tough because growth has come in spurts, it�s full of surprises because it is still developing and we�re seeing new policies (state and central), and it�s promising because the government has set a clear target and the growth we�ve seen in the past two years gives hope to everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have grown exponentially in the past three years and � here I am quoting your (Mercom) numbers � solar prices have declined by more than 70 percent. New policies are being developed to tackle these new challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDespite the exponential growth of the Indian market that you pointed out, we see that you are exporting a good portion of your manufactured products. Why is that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a supply shortage in China as well as heightened demand in China, the U.S., and Europe. So, we are supplying them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the major challenges you face when competing with Chinese suppliers in India?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe competition is not fair. It is not a level playing field when someone is dumping goods at cheap prices. If they are sending supplies to India at less than the manufacturing cost, how are we supposed to compete with them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey have kept their module prices high in other markets, which compensates them for the cheap prices in India. These companies aren�t even dumping at a loss in India because this cross subsidization balances out their costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there any plans for scaling up further in India?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. This year our manufacturing will be a minimum of 1.2 GW and a maximum of up to 1.7 GW. In the past four years, we have spent a substantial amount on R\u0026amp;D. We want to lead the sector and that is only possible by investing in cutting-edge technology in order to develop high-quality products. We are also setting up an inverter manufacturing unit in India.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have any comments on the anti-dumping case?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis should have been done a bit earlier. We are late as a nation in this. But, now, the government has started the requisite procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou said we are late as a nation. What about in 2014\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e� when anti-dumping petitioners took back their petition?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2014, the sector was not as developed as it is today. It could not supply itself. Back then, anti‑dumping (tariffs) would have slowed down growth because local manufacturing capacity was negligible � hence the petitioners saw logic and took back the petition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, we have set cell and module manufacturing capacity that can be scaled up within months to consistently supply close to 8 GW of modules and 6-7 GW of cells. There�s no backing out of the petition this time around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow has the Goods and Services Tax (GST) affected the sector?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe GST has created a lot of uproar in the sector, and the ambiguity that surrounds the applicable rate slabs isn�t helping the sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now, as a module manufacturer, the GST is straight-forward 5 percent. But, as an EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) developer, even now I�m not sure regarding the various applicable GST rates for various components like inverters, BOS (balance-of-system equipment), etcetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you think about the viability of low solar tariffs?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, these tariffs are viable. If companies are bidding that means they have done their math and it makes sense to them. Solar projects are more of financial engineering. If interest rates go down by 0.25 percent or 0.50 percent, then tariffs at ₹2/kWh can be viable for few players. The ease of borrowing has increased in India.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorld Bank Group members, ADB, Middle East financial institutions, and others are looking at the Indian market as a new avenue and this has made huge funds available to developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will Waaree\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e�s strategy be in the face of increasing market competitiveness?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuality services and tariff competitiveness are where we will be ahead of the rest. We believe in delivering quality products at the right price and providing credible services. Doing this will ensure that we stay ahead of the pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a good customer base and we will grow with our customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about the proposed 7.5 GW Central Public-Sector Unit (CPSU) program?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a good initiative that provides visibility to local manufacturers. It is easy to invest when one has a visibility of three years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis target will also lead to reduced prices for modules and cells because firms can plan for long-term investment when they are sure there will be demand. This will allow them to scale up according to a set plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are some of the other challenges you have experienced?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTendering should be consistent. Government tenders take place in bursts with long lulls in between. There�s activity for three- or four-months, then no tendering or auctioning for a quarter. The lack of consistent demand affects manufacturing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have any other comments?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe government of India should impose an anti-dumping duty as soon as possible, this will also bolster the Make in India program.\u003c/p\u003e   ",

									"News_Body": "\u003cp\u003eWaaree Energies Ltd, one of India's most diversified and fastest growing solar power Solutions Company, today announced the launch of the new 1500V System Voltage (\"1500V\") crystalline solar module at the Renewable Energy India Expo, 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe conventional 1000V system voltage allows PV system designed\u0026nbsp;only up to 1000V. The new\u0026nbsp;1500V module has proven its performance under UL 1703; Standard for Flat-Plate Photovoltaic Modules and Panels and allows a significantly more efficient system design while reducing the overall BOS and cabling costs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRaising the maximum system voltage to 1500V means a potential increase of up to 50% in string length, hence reducing the overall BOS cost. It is an inevitable trend that 1500V systems would begin to be installed on a global scale in the future, not so far away. The module still remains PID (Potential Induced Degradation) resistant as per IEC 62804. The company announced the successful completion of the project at the much coveted Renewable Energy India Expo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpeaking on the launch, Mr. Hitesh Doshi, Chairman \u0026amp; Managing Director, Waaree Energies Ltd, commented\u003c/strong\u003e, \"We are immensely excited about this project as it is a milestone for us at Waaree. This marks a momentous win for us as it adds to our already high quality database of modules. 1500 V module comes packed with a whole lot of inherent advantages which are absent in 1000 V modules. Certain key ones include the lowering of balance of system costs as high voltage systems allows more number of modules to be connected in a single string and thus reduces the number of combiner boxes, shorter runs of wiring, trenching, labor, DC breakers and, overall loss to the system. We believe this new product can perfectly meet the growing demand for higher voltage systems\u0026nbsp;with lower system costs.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Infact, installing 1500V DC systems in place of the now-used 1000V DC can lower costs by as much as $ 0.05 per watt, which by itself is noteworthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Additionally, installation and maintenance costs also comes down once you start using 1500V design in PV arrays.
